Lineage Dungeon Crawler

Premise is to have an auto-generated dungeon with random monsters.
The hero's goal is to clear the dungeon and advance onto the next path.
The hero at any point is able to "retire".

Upon retiring the current pc the player will be able to play one of the kids or select a random pc.
With this the player will be given the chance to select better and better traits creating an ultra pc.

Also adding in the Family Tree View.
